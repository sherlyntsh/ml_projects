artificial intelligence researcher widely pioneer field many suddenly danger ai seeking exploiting robot attracted attention good ai healthcare etc potential revolutionize various industry improve life clear equal danger bad actor leverage technology personal gain towards future reason chance juergen schmidhuber understand perspective seemingly leap u future 1970s juergen schmidhuber became fascinated idea creating intelligent machine learn improve becoming smarter within lifetime ultimately lead groundbreaking field deep learning studied computer science technical university tum thesis ultimate machine learn learning algorithm learn improve learning algorithm decade later became hot topic received phd tum foundation modern ai schmidhuber best known contribution development recurrent neural network rnns powerful type artificial neural network process sequential data speech natural language student others published architecture training algorithm long shortterm memory lstm type rnn widely natural language processing speech recognition video game robotics application lstm become neural network century business week called commercial ai throughout career schmidhuber received various groundbreaking prize significant contribution field machine learning ieee neural network pioneer contribution deep learning neural network medium often called modern ai neural build lab quick

currently ai scientific ai lab cofounder scientist ai company whose ai saying ai continues cuttingedge ai technology application improve human health extend human life life easier everyone following

10 different people hear 10 different opinion good opinion completely dont forget enormous amount many people letter say quickly put place government problem different government different opinion good others great power say dont great power b perhaps gain advantage u true great power c jones everyone fear surrounding current generative ai technology moreover existential threat technology publicly sam altman openai calling ai regulation perspective existential threat schmidhuber true ai doubt kind ai arm race ai introduce quality existential threat threat coming ai weapon seems comparison older threat nuclear dont ai afraid tech form almost 15 time power weapon combined despite nuclear since still enough nuclear warhead human within two hour without ai old existential threat rather harmless ai weapon jones realize compare ai threat nuclear current danger current technology put hand human enable eventually exact harm individual group precise targeted drone attack giving people theyve never enabling bad actor pointed able lot previously didnt technology schmidhuber sound principle existing law sufficient deal type weapon enabled ai kill someone gun go kill someone drone law better understanding threat weapon respond better technology threat enabling drone target person distance requires tracking intelligence perform performed human seems improved version traditional weapon gun little bit smarter old gun principle development many century evolution better law policy react threat time suddenly quality existential threat six decade large nuclear warhead doesnt fancy face recognition kill individual simply entire city ten million jones existential threat thats implied extent human control technology see early case say tends medium attention positive breakthrough youre balance schmidhuber historically long technological breakthrough led advancement weapon purpose defense stick drone influence human history consistent throughout history technology achieve end facing technology side learning thats repeated thousand year human history continue dont see ai arm race something remotely existential threat good old nuclear warhead said something important people prefer talk downside rather benefit technology thats misleading 95 ai research ai development making people advancing human life health jones let touch beneficial advance ai research able change present day method achieve breakthrough schmidhuber right example year ago team dan first win medical imaging competition deep analyzed breast cell objective determine harmless cell v stage typically trained long time team knew nothing cancer able train artificial neural network totally dumb beginning lot kind data able outperform method today breast cancer detecting many thing neural network developed last 3 decade prevalent across thousand healthcare application detecting eventually across healthcare good consequence type ai important conducting ai jones adoption product outcome massive scale adoption either lead u believe people led technology positive effect people life schmidhuber latter likely case there intense commercial pressure towards good ai rather bad ai company sell something going buy stuff think going good already simple commercial pressure bias towards good ai rather bad ai however scenario movie attention ai improve people life jones people good story contain struggle end happy consistent comment human nature history despite tendency humanity somehow tends correct let take example technology aware gans general adversarial network today application fake news purpose invention gans far today schmidhuber yes name gans created basic principle already early 30 year ago called artificial curiosity simple creativity little two network system creative ai trying imitate human rather goal let explain two network network producing output anything action second network looking action trying predict consequence action action move robot something happens network trying predict happen implement artificial curiosity reducing prediction error second network time reward first network first network maximize reward invent action lead situation surprise second network yet learned predict well case output fake image first network try generate image good enough second network attempt predict environment fake real image try become better first network continue improve generating image whose type second network able predict 2nd network continue reduce prediction error network attempt maximize game first network better better producing convincing fake output look almost realistic interesting set image van generate image leverage style without original artist ever produced jones see van example applied education setting example artist style famous image generation instance happen within second quite another gans whats prevalent today generating image information people surface harm deal threat intellectual property copyright law yet account perspective intention model motivation early gans schmidhuber old motivation gans actually important create fake news enable ai curious invent goal explore environment

particular science lab many first example artificial scientist yet convincing enough appear screen public space currently fascinated simpler system imitate human write text based previously seen document jones speak numerous instance back 30 year lab experiment agent learning moving theyve learned assume rate learning becomes even faster time kind talking eventually taken outside lab embedded society schmidhuber still take month even year anyway future probably see artificial scientist good experiment allow discover previously unknown physical law always going profit old trend held least since every decade compute getting 100 time cheaper jones trend affect modern ai chatgpt schmidhuber perhaps recent famous ai application chatgpt similar model largely based principle artificial neural network invented previous main reason well incredible acceleration compute per dollar chatgpt driven neural network called transformer described google happy century earlier particular transformer variant called transformer selfattention back done compute cost million time higher today today train model half internet achieve interesting result jones long acceleration continue schmidhuber there reason believe next 30 year wont another factor 1 million thats going really significant near future first time many expensive device compute human brain physical limit computation however even trend factor 100 every decade continues physical limit instruction per second matter wont hit say century even current century however well probably many machine compute 10 billion human brain collectively imagine everything change jones big question everything going change say next generation leader currently coming college university change already study future defined purpose change system adapt version intelligence schmidhuber decade people asked question saying basically said since 1970s today people paying attention back thought science didnt think ever come close achieving crazy life goal building machine learns become smarter many changed mind think two 23 25 people ask tell always said seems likely within lifetime type intelligence probably going many
